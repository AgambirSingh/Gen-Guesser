#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pqde8v-0ak&t=6s
#### Description:
This project is a web application that identifies a user's generation based on their speech patterns. It uses Python's Flask framework to create a backend that processes user input and matches it against pre-defined keywords for different generations (e.g., Gen Z, Boomer, Gen Alpha).

#### How It Works:
1. The user enters a sentence in the text area on the web page.
2. The application analyzes the text and identifies the associated generation(s).
3. The result is displayed dynamically on the page.

#### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

#### Technologies Used:
